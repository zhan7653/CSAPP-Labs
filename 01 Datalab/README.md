# Datalab: Bit-Level Integer and Floating-Point Coding Lab

## Overview

Datalab is an engaging lab that forms part of the Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP) course. It introduces students to the fascinating world of bit-level manipulations and data representation in C. This lab focuses on developing an in-depth understanding of bit representations, two's complement arithmetic, and IEEE floating point arithmetic through a hands-on approach.

The lab consists of a series of programming exercises that challenge students to implement specified mathematical functions under a unique set of constraints. The primary goal is to deepen the student's knowledge and problem-solving skills in a bit-level programming context.

## Lab Tasks

Students are required to work on a file named `bits.c`, which includes a series of programming "puzzles". Each puzzle presents an empty function that the student must implement to perform a specified mathematical operation, such as computing the absolute value of a number.

The lab exercises are carefully designed to require the use of straight-line code (no loops or conditionals) and a limited subset of C's arithmetic and logical operators. This constraint not only makes the puzzles more challenging but also encourages students to think creatively about bit-level operations.

## Student's Contributions

### Implemented Functions

All student-implemented functions are located in the `bits.c` file. This file contains template functions that students must complete to pass the lab's requirements. The functions cover a range of topics from basic bit-level manipulations to more complex operations involving floating-point representations.

### Key Features

- **Straight-line code**: Implementations do not use loops or conditionals.
- **Limited operator set**: Solutions use only a restricted set of operators, emphasizing the power of bitwise operations.
- **Comprehensive coverage**: The functions span a variety of bit manipulation techniques, including masking, shifting, and logical operations.
