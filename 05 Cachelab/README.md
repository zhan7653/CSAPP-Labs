# Cachelab: Understanding Cache Memory

## Overview

Cachelab is a hands-on lab that is part of the "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" (CS:APP) course curriculum. This lab aims to deepen students' understanding of cache memories by having them simulate a cache's behavior and optimize memory usage in matrix operations.

## Lab Objectives

The objectives of Cachelab are twofold:

1. **Cache Simulation**: Implement a cache simulator that can replay traces of memory accesses and mimic the behavior of a cache memory with specific configurations.
2. **Matrix Transpose Optimization**: Optimize a given matrix transpose function to minimize the number of cache misses, thereby improving performance on a simulated cache.

## Student's Contributions

### Cache Simulator

Students will implement the cache simulation in the file `csim.c`. This implementation involves:

- Parsing command-line arguments to configure the cache settings (e.g., number of sets, lines per set, and block size).
- Reading and processing memory access traces, simulating how each access affects the cache state.
- Reporting the total number of hits, misses, and evictions experienced by the cache during the simulation.

### Matrix Transpose Optimization

For the optimization part, students are expected to modify the file `trans.c`, where they will:

- Implement an efficient matrix transpose function that works well with the simulated cache configuration.
- Experiment with different strategies to reduce the number of cache misses, such as blocking.
