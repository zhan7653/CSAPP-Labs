# Attacklab: Buffer Overflow Attack Lab

## Overview

Attacklab is part of the "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" (CS:APP) course and is designed to teach students about the stack discipline on x86-64 processors through hands-on experience. The lab involves conducting a series of buffer overflow attacks on executable files, specifically focusing on code injection and return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks.

## Lab Objective

The primary goal of this lab is to provide students with a practical understanding of how buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited. Students are given binary files, `ctarget` and `rtarget`, containing buffer overflow bugs. The task is to alter the behavior of these binaries through five exploits of increasing complexityâ€”three involving code injection and two based on return-oriented programming.

## Student's Contributions

### Analysis and Solutions

Students work with several key files throughout this lab:

- **Binary Files (`ctarget` and `rtarget`)**: The targets for the buffer overflow attacks.
- **Exploit Files (`exploit*.txt`)**: Text files containing the hex representation of the exploit payloads developed by the student.
- **Raw Exploit Files (`exploit*-raw.txt`)**: Generated by converting `exploit*.txt` files using the `hex2raw` utility, these files contain the raw bytes to be fed into the target binaries.

### Implemented Exploits

Students develop a series of exploit files that are used to demonstrate successful attacks against the `ctarget` and `rtarget` binaries. These include:

- `exploit1.txt` through `exploit5.txt`: Each file contains a unique payload designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities within the targets.
- Corresponding `-raw.txt` files: The actual byte sequences that, when executed against the vulnerable binaries, alter their behavior as intended by the exploit.
